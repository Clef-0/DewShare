Physalis is a one-page, two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Change](http://change.connorbaer.io), another theme by [Connor BÃ¤r](http://connorbaer.io).

### Browser support

Physalis is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 11 and above.

### Download

Physalis is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/madebyconnor/physalis">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.
